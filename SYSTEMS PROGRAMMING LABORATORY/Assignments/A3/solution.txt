s = 13932



Use of gdb:

run by command:

gdb oops

Step 1: Putting Breakpoint at Line no 16 of the source code by command

break 16

so gdb stops before execution of the instruction

r=f(n);

Step 2: while running through gdb with my roll number with the command

run 21CS10016

the execution stops at line 16.

we give the instruction 

set var n=x 

where x is an integer of our choice and hence we change the value of n from 10000 to x

we continue our execution with the command

continue

Hence the function f is called with new integer x and we get the value of f(x)

Step 3:

We know and also verify that f(10000)=0 and f(20000)=1 and there exists a s which in the smallest integer for which f is 1

We execute a binary search to find s by using step 2 with changing the value of x

The search is given as follows

f(10000) = 0

f(20000) = 1

f(15000) = 1

f(12500) = 0

f(13750) = 0

f(14375) = 1

f(14062) = 1

f(13906) = 0

f(13984) = 1

f(13945) = 1

f(13925) = 0

f(13935) = 1

f(13930) = 0

f(13932) = 1 <--Answer

f(13931) = 0
